# FNACustom

This is a small modification of the FNA game development framework with an entity-component system (or ECS), similar to what you'd see in 
Unity.

This contains the source code as well as a few other things.

I recommend using Visual Studio 2019 or later for this, as that's what this was written using.

Thank you.
